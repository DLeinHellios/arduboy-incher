# Incher - A Game About Guiding Worms
![Title](screenshots/title.gif?raw=true)

## Description
Incher is a worm-guiding simulator for the [Arduboy](https://arduboy.com) game system. Through some unknown mishap, a handful of good worms are trapped deep behind enemy lines. It is your duty to guide them home, one inch at a time. The path is laden with traps set by the maniacal faces. Avoid these hazards, reach the portals, and prevent your worms' untimely demise.

## Gameplay
Incher is a Rogue-lite with an emphasis on the "lite" - all you do is move. Use the d-pad to navigate your worms, avoiding the bombs and faces, collect the key, reach the portal, repeat. Maps are chosen at random, and map elements are further randomized. The faces make their move between each inch, and appear to be a little more nimble than our valiant worm friends. This tower has to end sometime, doesn't it?
